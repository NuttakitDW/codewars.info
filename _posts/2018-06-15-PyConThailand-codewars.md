In 2018, Dylan Jay created a [Codewars as a warm up event to the first PyCon Thailand](https://2019.th.pycon.org/pycon2018/code-war/index.html). Any language was allowed but python seemed to win anyway.

Memorable because last minute the quizzmaster had somehow lost the answers to the questions so instead the organisers were solving them barely ahead of the contestants. It also seems we relaxed the 3 person per team rule.
