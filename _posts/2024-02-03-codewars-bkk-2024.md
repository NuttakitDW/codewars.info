It's great if you can come with a team, but you will still need to compete in the qualification round. If at least of one of your team solves the qualification round fastest, they can invite others to join their team of 3-5 people for the knockout round.

Yes! If you are one of the winners of the qualification round we'll help you find more people to join your team so you have 3-5 total.
