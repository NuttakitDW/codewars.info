In 2014 Dylan Jay moved to Bangkok and started the first Python Meetup (ThaiPy), the BKK Hack Night and also introduced the
Codewars concept at the [end of 2016 as a social event for the BKK Hack Night](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/bkkhack/events/cxdkxlyvqbmc/).

Memorable by getting kicked out of the venue at midnight and having to run the final at the regular meetup the following month. Teams were only 2 due to limited space and turnout.
